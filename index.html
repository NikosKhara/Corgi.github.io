                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>
                    Corgis originate from Pembroke, Welsh.<br><br>
Corgi’s are in the herding group of dogs, are 10 - 12 inches tall, up to 30Lb, and live 12 - 13 years.<br><br>

They’re pretty good with kids but can get really excited so its worth keeping an eye on them sometimes, same thing when they’re with other dogs.<br><br>

They’re pretty easy to train but are also really smart so they can disobey you on purpose.<br><br>

They have a pretty long coat and shed an insane amount, especially during spring and autumn which is there shedding season.<br><br>

They also love to be loud and bark, have a ton of energy, love to play whenever possible, and are really hard to buy as puppy's.<br><br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Corgis are very energetic and require a lot of work. However that makes them great for learning how to be responsible for something.<br><br>

They are awesome for your first dog, very sweet, and smart.<br><br>

However if you want your house to be clean you should also brush them at least once a week and vacuum a lot.<br><br>

They need to be played with/ran around with at least once a day.<br><br>

You should feed them 2 - 3 times a day with a quarter cup of dog food. (Note - They will beg for more)<br><br>
